							<ul>
								<li>C# & C++</li>
								<li>Unity</li>

							<h2>That Golf Game</h2>
							<p>A simple white boxed game made within Unity. Includes, a store, 2 levels 18 holes, and 1 maze level. All information (store and level info) is saved to the device.</p>
							<p>This golf game was designed for android mobile and was primerily tested on a Huawei P20 Pro. Created in Unity and programmed in C#. The background music heard throughout was sourced from an open source site, and sound effects were made by myself. This project was my first attempt at using sound within Unity and it is a skill I aim to develop greatly.</P>

						<h2>BattleSide</h2>
						<p>A multiplayer, 2D, platform, shooter. Each player only appears on their section of the screen, making people utilise the idea of screen cheating</p>
						<p>Made as part of a group project I had involvement in multiple aspects of this project. I was involved in creating the functionality of; player movement, level initialization, weapons and pick-ups, and pick-up spawning. Furthermore, I created all non-menu animations from assets supplied by designers, as well as creating and implementing sound effects (grenade sound). Not only this but I also created all levels present in the game, using assets supplied by designers.</p>

						<h2>Level Editor</h2>
						<p>A simple tile based level editor. Containing a multitude of tile designs it makes a great tool to make tile based games or backgrounds.</p>
						<p>This project was my first interaction with the WPF framework and allowed me to develop skills required to create the necessary fundamentals for .NET. Furthermore this was my first interaction with save systems for applications through the use of JSON. From here I aimed to find better ways to develop save mechanics for future projects.</p>

						<h2>Raycaster</h2>
						<p>A simple raycasing prototype, with basic movement and random paths. Based on original Wolfenstein/ Doom games.</p>
						<p>Created using C++ the prototype was the first time I had attempted make anything outside of the Unity Engine that was in a 3D environment. However, this gave me the inspiration to delve deeper into such forms of games production, which I am now doing in the form of a module that focuses on the rendering of 3D models.</p>

						<h2>Lunar Lander</h2>
						<p>A basic Lunar Lander idea made with asci characters. Created to randomize between two level designs, track and save your high score and use basic asci animations.</p>
						<p>Created using the C++ language this game was one of my earlier  attempts at c++ programming. Despite this I believe  it demonstrates how simple functionality and graphics can come together to create an enjoyable experience. Through the creation of this project I developed many skills and founded a solid understanding in the C++ language.</p>
